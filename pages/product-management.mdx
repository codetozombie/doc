# Product Management

This section covers the explicit management of Simple Products, Bundles, Images, and Categories.

## 1. Simple Products
Standard items sold directly.

| Action | Method | Endpoint | Description |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Create** | `POST` | `/products/simple/` | Create a new simple product. |
| **Update** | `PUT` | `/products/simple/{id}/` | Update details of a simple product. |

## 2. Bundle Products
Collections of simple products sold as one unit.

| Action | Method | Endpoint | Description |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Create** | `POST` | `/products/bundle/` | Create a new bundle. |
| **Update** | `PUT` | `/products/bundle/{id}/` | Update bundle details (price, name). |

### Managing Bundle Content
To change the actual products inside a bundle:

* **Add Product to Bundle**: `PUT /products/bundle/{bundle_id}/items/`
  * Body requires: `product_id` (The ID of the Simple Product to add).
* **Delete Product from Bundle**: `DELETE /products/bundle/items/{item_id}/`
  * Note: Use the `item_id` (the link ID), not the product ID.

## 3. Product Images
Images can be added to both Simple and Bundle products using the same endpoints.

* **Add Image**: `POST /products/images/`
  * Body requires: `product` (ID of the product) and `image` (file).
* **Delete Image**: `DELETE /products/images/{image_id}/`

## 4. General Product Operations
Operations that apply to any product type.

* **List All**: `GET /products/`
* **Retrieve One**: `GET /products/{id}/`
* **Delete Product**: `DELETE /products/{id}/`

## 5. Product Categories
Organize your catalog.

* **List**: `GET /products/categories/`
* **Create**: `POST /products/categories/`
* **Retrieve**: `GET /products/categories/{id}/`
* **Update**: `PUT /products/categories/{id}/`
* **Delete**: `DELETE /products/categories/{id}/`

# Product Management

Merchants can manage a diverse catalog of items across multiple stores.
The Product API supports different product types, categorization, and inventory tracking.

## Overview

The Product API allows you to:
- **Create** products attached to specific stores.
- **Categorize** items for better organization.
- **Manage** inventory tracking.
- **Bundle** multiple products into a single deal.

## Product Types

The system supports two distinct types of products:

| Type | Description |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Simple** | A standard physical or digital item (e.g., "Wireless Mouse"). |
| **Bundle** | A collection of Simple products sold together as a single unit (e.g., "Work From Home Kit"). |

## Endpoints

### List & Create Products
<div className="api-badge get">GET</div> <div className="api-badge post">POST</div> `/products/`

Retrieve a list of products. You can filter results by:
- `store_id`: Get products for a specific store.
- `category_id`: Get products in a specific category.
- `type`: Filter by "Simple" or "Bundle".

### Product Categories
<div className="api-badge get">GET</div> <div className="api-badge post">POST</div> `/products/categories/`

Manage the taxonomy of your catalog. Categories help organize products for your customers.

> **Note on Bundles:** When creating a **Bundle** product, you must specify the `bundle_items` list, which references existing **Simple** products and their quantities.

# Store Management

Merchants can manage multiple stores under a single account. A store represents a physical or online entity that holds products and processes transactions.

## Overview

The Store API allows you to:
- **Create** new stores (Physical or Online).
- **Update** store details, including uploading logos.
- **List** all active stores owned by your account.
- **Delete** stores (with intelligent soft-delete protection if products exist).

## Endpoints

### List & Create Stores
<div className="api-badge get">GET</div> <div className="api-badge post">POST</div> `/stores/`

Use the `GET` method to retrieve all your stores. Use `POST` to create a new one.

### Store Details
<div className="api-badge get">GET</div> <div className="api-badge patch">PATCH</div> <div className="api-badge delete">DELETE</div> `/stores/{id}/`

Manage a specific store. 

> **Note on Deletion:** If you attempt to delete a store that already has products attached to it, the system will **deactivate** the store (soft delete) to preserve transaction history, rather than permanently deleting the record.

## Image Handling
When creating or updating a store, the `logo` field accepts a **Base64 encoded string**. The API will decode this, save the image file, and return a full URL in the response.

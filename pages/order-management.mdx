# Order Management

Merchants can create orders and send payment links directly to customers via WhatsApp. Customers can view and cancel their pending orders.

## Order Workflow
1. **Create**: Merchant creates an order with products and a customer WhatsApp number.
2. **Notify**: System generates a payment link and sends it to the customer.
3. **Status**: The order starts as `Pending`. It updates to `Paid` upon successful payment, or `Cancelled` if revoked.
